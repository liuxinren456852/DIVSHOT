# DIVSHOT 
</div>

### Introduction

**A lightweight radiance field renderer and training platform client that supports flexible editing tools for editing and cropping trained Gaussian splats for export, as well as rendering them to images or videos.**

It originated from a 2023 paper [gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting). Initially, it was created for learning purposes to implement this paper in C++, aiming to build a real-time visualization training tool similar to [instantngp](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp). After the emergence of SuperSplat, I was inspired to expand its functionality. After 2 years of spare time development, it has now become a comprehensive and practical tool.

<!-- * 4. Python3 -->
**Note:** Please ensure you update to the latest graphics card driver, otherwise there may be some issues.

**Explanation:** The current program consists of 2 parts: the training part and the rendering/editing part. These two parts are relatively independent and decoupled. Currently, the open-source code includes the rendering and editing part, which is written using Vulkan and C++, meaning it can be compiled and run on multiple platforms. The training part is implemented using libtorch C++ and CUDA, which requires running on NVIDIA graphics cards. Although CUDA can be run on AMD graphics cards through the AMD HIP technology framework, this requires additional development time and will be completed in the future.

Operating systems:

* Windows
* Mac (Will be in future)
* Linux (Will be in future)

**Note:** Currently refactoring a new framework to support multi-platform training, planned to be named RadField Studio. It will become a professional scanning tool for CG workflows. Stay tuned!

## Run

For general users, you can directly use the latest [Release](https://github.com/fenghuayumo/DIVSHOT/releases) installation package, which includes all dependencies and can be run directly.

Note: The training source code does not provide SFM calculation for camera poses and point clouds. Please use third-party software to process and obtain them, then drag the corresponding files to the viewport. Currently supports Colmap, RealityCapture, NerfStudio, MetaShape.
